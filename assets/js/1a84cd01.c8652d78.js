If omitted, the registered name of this type will be used. |\\n| Prefixes | String containing default **Prefixed Union Types** for this type. This property should omit the initial type name, so this string should begin with a prefix character, e.g. `Prefixes = \\"# integer ! boolean\\"`. |\\n| Transform | Transform is an optional function that is passed two values: the raw text, and the player running the command. Then, whatever values this function returns will be passed to all other functions in the type (`Validate`, `Autocomplete`, and `Parse`). |\\n| Validate | The `Validate` function is passed whatever is returned from the Transform function (or the raw value if there is no Transform function). If the value is valid for the type, it should return true. If it the value is invalid, it should return two values: false, and a string containing an error message. If this function isn\'t present, anything will be considered valid. |\\n| ValidateOnce | This function works exactly the same as the normal `Validate` function, except it only runs once (after the user presses Enter). This should only be used if the validation process is relatively expensive or needs to yield. For example, the PlayerId type uses this because it needs to call `GetUserIdFromNameAsync` in order to validate. For the vast majority of types, you should just use `Validate` instead. |\\n| AutoComplete |  A function that returns a list of possible completions for the value. Returns a list of strings and an optional boolean indicating if the completions are partial. |\\n| Parse | Parse is the only required function in a type definition. It is the final step before the value is considered finalized. This function should return the actual parsed value that will be sent to the command functions. |\\n| Default | The `Default` function is optional and should return the \\"default\\" value for this type, as a string. For example, the default value of the `players` type is the name of the player who ran the command. |\\n| Listable | If you set the optional key Listable to true in your table, this will tell Cmdr that comma-separated lists are allowed for this type. Cmdr will automatically split the list and parse each segment through your Transform, Validate, Autocomplete, and Parse functions individually, so you don\'t have to change the logic of your Type at all. The only limitation is that your Parse function must return a table. The tables from each individual segment\'s Parse will be merged into one table at the end of the parse step. The uniqueness of values is ensured upon merging, so even if the user lists the same value several times, it will only appear once in the final table.","fields":[{"name":"DisplayName","lua_type":"string","desc":""},{"name":"Prefixes","lua_type":"string","desc":""},{"name":"Transform","lua_type":"nil | (rawText: string, executor: Player) -> any","desc":""},{"name":"Validate","lua_type":"nil | (value: T) -> (boolean, string?)","desc":""},{"name":"ValidateOnce","lua_type":"nil | (value: T) -> (boolean, string?)","desc":""},{"name":"Autocomplete","lua_type":"nil | (value: T) -> ({string}, {IsPartial: boolean?})","desc":""},{"name":"Parse","lua_type":"(value: T) -> any","desc":""},{"name":"Default","lua_type":"(plr: Player) -> string","desc":""},{"name":"Listable","lua_type":"boolean","desc":""}],"source":{"line":35,"path":"lib/cmdrhandler/src/Shared/CmdrTypes.luau"}},{"name":"ArgumentContext","desc":"","fields":[{"name":"Command","lua_type":"CommandContext","desc":"The command context this argument belongs to."},{"name":"Name","lua_type":"string","desc":"The name of the argument"},{"name":"Type","lua_type":"TypeDefinition","desc":"The type definition of the argument"},{"name":"Required","lua_type":"boolean","desc":"Whether or not this argument is required"},{"name":"Executor","lua_type":"Player","desc":"The player that ran the command this argument belongs to."},{"name":"RawValue","lua_type":"string","desc":"The raw value of the argument"},{"name":"RawSegments","lua_type":"{string}","desc":"The raw segments of the argument"},{"name":"Prefix","lua_type":"string","desc":"The prefix of the argument"}],"source":{"line":60,"path":"lib/cmdrhandler/src/Shared/CmdrTypes.luau"}},{"name":"CommandContext","desc":"https://eryn.io/Cmdr/api/CommandContext.html#commandcontext","fields":[{"name":"Executor","lua_type":"Player","desc":"The player who executed the command"},{"name":"Name","lua_type":"string","desc":"the name of the command"},{"name":"Description","lua_type":"string","desc":"the description of the command"},{"name":"Alias","lua_type":"string","desc":"The specific alias of this command that was used to trigger this command (may be the same as Name)"},{"name":"Aliases","lua_type":"{string}","desc":"The list of aliases that could have been used to trigger this command"},{"name":"Group","lua_type":"any","desc":"The group this command is a part of.
