It removes all networking and replication\\nfunctionality, and instead focuses on providing a simple methodology to easily\\ninitialize Services given to it.\\n\\nRoam gathers a collection of specified services and initializes \'syncronously\'.\\nOnce all services have been fully initialized, it then starts them \'asyncronously\' by\\nspawning their \'RoamStart\' method in a new thread.\\n\\nRoam is RunContext agnostic, meaning it can be used on both the server and client in the same manner.\\nIt makes no distinction between the two, and instead focuses on providing a simple\\ninterface for initializing and starting services. This means you could create a service and register it on \\nboth the server and client, and it will be initialized and started on both ends. \\n\\n**[CONTRACTS]**\\n- Services must be created/registered before Roam is started.\\n- Services must be created/registered with a unique name.\\n- Services with `RoamInit` and `RoamStart` methods will have those methods\\n  called when Roam is started at the appropriate time. (Names are configurable)\\n- `RequiredServices` boot in proper topological order if specified in the ServiceConfig.\\n- Roam functions the same regardless of RunContext (Server/Client).\\n\\n**[EXAMPLE STARTUP]**\\n```lua -- ServerBootstrapper.Server.lua\\nlocal Roam = require(ReplicatedStorage.Roam)\\n\\n-- Just iterates through all the children of the given parents\\n-- and requires any module scripts that match the given predicate\\nRoam.requireModules({\\n\\tReplicatedStorage.Shared;\\n\\tServerScriptService.Server;\\n})\\n\\n-- Start Roam\\nRoam.start()\\n:andThenCall(print, \\"Roam started!\\")\\n:catch(warn)\\n```\\n\\n:::info Setting up Services\\nServices can be set up in a variety of ways. The most common way is to create a ModuleScript\\nthat returns a table with the methods you want to define, and then register it with Roam just prior\\nto the final module\'s return.\\n\\nSee [Roam.registerService](Roam#registerService) for more information on setting up a new service.\\n:::\\n\\n:::tip Networking\\nRoam does not inherently have networking functionality. However, it can easily be added through the use of NetWire\'s \\n**[.setupServiceNetworking](https://raild3x.github.io/ModulesOnRails/api/ServerNetWire/#setupServiceNetworking)** funtion.\\n:::","source":{"line":63,"path":"lib/roam/src/init.luau"}}')}}]);
